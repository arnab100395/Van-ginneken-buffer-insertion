# Van-ginneken-buffer-insertion
-> Implemented the Van-Ginneken Buffer insertion algorithm in C to find the optimal number of buffers and where they should be placed which would maximize the Required Arrival time for any circuit.
-> The Circuit is a Binary tree where a parent node can have at most 2 children nodes and is represented as a rectilinear minimum Steiner tree. The total number of nodes is 2*n where n is the number of sinks and there is a driver node.
-> The input was provided in a text file which specifies the number of sinks, the Required Arrival time (RAT) and capacitance of sink nodes, the connections between the driver, Steiner nodes and sinks nodes and the wire length between the different nodes in the circuit.
